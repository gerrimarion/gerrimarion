## *Possible Research Options*

- "Cozy" Games and the Gender Breakdowns/Assumptions 
	- I noticed that games that are considered "cozy" games are chore-type games and targeted predominately for women. I talk about this more in the first journal entry, but I want to look into why "cozy" games are advertised and marketed more towards women. I'd also want to see the actual gender breakdowns of these games. 

- "Whataboutmeism"
	- A TikTok "term," also known as the "Bean Soup Theory." The idea started because someone posted a recipe on TikTok about a bean soup recipe (basically, a soup involving a bunch of different beans). Someone commented along the lines of "What if I don't like beans?" 
	- It's something that's been going on really ever since. If someone is interested in something or likes something, there are comments trying to find that person at fault for it. Like they should be ashamed of their interests. I want to look into this more because I'm wondering if this is a "screaming into the void" kind of thing, or if this involves something completely different.
